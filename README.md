# rogueish
Traditional roguelike based on the tutorial at https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/part-1-graphics.html

*Abandoned* due to the fact that tcod is an older library. It doesn't seem to play well with 2021 edition of rust. I may come back to this if I figure out how to do error handling for this particular problem. I did this as part of a tutorial to help me learn rust, but trying to solve the issue is beyond my abilities at the moment. As far as I can tell, it's something to do with the way tcod handles keyboard or mouse input. Output as follows:
